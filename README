./union_svm_bow_vs_combi_annotated.tsv
    Human judgments on Union dataset
./union_svm_bow_vs_combi.order
    Since the emojis are randomized, this file provides the indices of [original, bow, combi] emojis
    respectively. For example [2, 1, 0] means the original emoji is presented as Third Emoji, emoji
    predicted by BoW system is presented as Second Emoji, and emoji predicted by combi system is
    presented as First Emoji (and the raters rated accordingly)

./union_train_emoji_emotions.tweet
./union_validation_emoji_emotions.tweet
./union_test_emoji_emotions.tweet
    The train, validation, and test set, including the predicted emotions
    Note that for tweet ID all-N with N < 589000 we do not have access to the original Twitter ID.
    Please contact Francesco Barbieri for their dataset in their EACL 2017 paper titled "Are Emoji
    Predictable?" to get the list of tweets. The concatenation of 20_train, 20_validation, and
    20_test form the list of 589000 tweets, which are subsequently mapped into tweet ID all-N.

./union_tweet_to_twitter.map
    The mapping from our internal tweet ID (e.g., all-589001, crawled-153) into Twitter ID
    (e.g., 812015924374974464, 965773311283118080), because we cannot distribute the tweet texts

./semoji_utils.py
    The utility script to preprocess the downloaded tweets.
    See the main() function to see how it can be used to produce the final preprocessed tweets.
